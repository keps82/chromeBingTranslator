LOGIC FLOW
**********

We set up an actionListener with a response function as a parameter

the page loads

getPageInfo(onPageInfo) is called.
onPageInfo is a function.
It is the callback function.

onPageInfo is added to the stack for later use.

chrome tabs API is used to inject content_script.js into the current webpage.

content_script creates an object which contains info about the current webpage.
It sends a request to the chrome extension with this info.

When the extension receives the request, the actionListener is
triggered.  When the actionListener was defined, it was given a
function as an argument, and that function took a single argument.
Now the actionListener has been triggered by a request, containing the
page information JSON.  This page information JSON is the argument of
the function and that function is now called.

When the function is called, the first callback is taken off the stack
- in our case this is the onPageInfo function.

onPageInfo is called, with the JSON parameter: onPageInfo(JSON) and the  page information populates the "fromText" field. whew!
